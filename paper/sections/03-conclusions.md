## Conclusion

Use bash, and github to create my project and its strucutre. Then setup Makefile properly to assemble and produce doucments with pandoc. Writing in markdown language is simple and easy. These tools really simplifies and well organizes the way I work on this project. It takes me about three hours in total alone to finish this project. Most of parts are easy. What troubles me the most is how to resize the images in my output files. I did some research but I still don't know how to do so. I will continue to work on refining this project.
